# Cheep8

This Chip8 emulator has nothing innovative.

I'm creating this just to learn about emulation and C.
And, being the maniac I am, this is indeed the first time I've ever touched C.

## Build Instructions

To build and run Cheep8 on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine  `git clone https://github.com/JuanFricke/Cheep8`
2. **Remember to install Mingw32**: Mingw32 must be in your path. You can follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJmwrqbYZFQ) to easily understand how to install it on your Windows 8.1.
3. **Compile the source code**: In the emulator folder, use `mingw32-make` in the terminal to compile the source code.
4. **Running the emulator**: This can be done by using the terminal and executing `./bin/main.exe`. Or if you aren't that cool you can just double click in the exe file.
